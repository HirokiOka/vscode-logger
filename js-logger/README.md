This extension logs the JavaScript files you write.
This extension was created for the Kobe University course "Basic Programming Exercise I".

## Usage

1. Install this extension.
2. Enter the student ID number in the input window that appears in the vscode.

If you have entered a wrong student ID, you can change it by following the steps below:

1. In VSCode, open command palette (Windows: control + shift + p, Mac: command + shift + p).
2. Enter "changeId" in the command palette and execute the "changeId" command.
3. Enter the new student ID number in the input window that appears in the vscode.
